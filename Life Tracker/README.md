# Life Tracker

*"Build your own life tracker to help you record and organize your life!"*

## Inspiration
This idea came from my personal need for a **practical**, **all-in-one** tool to track different aspects of my life. Instead of keeping a to-do list open on my iPhone while also managing multiple Notes for health tracking and capturing quick-thoughts, I wanted a single place where everything could live together in a more structured and intentional way.

## What's included
The original prompt includes following sections:
- To-do lists
- Body metrics tracking
- Workout logs
- Media tracking
- Journaling

You are free to **customize the prompt based on your own needs**. For example:
- Add a **Diet** section to log daily meals
- Add a **Map** section to record travel experiences

If you don’t have additional requirements, you can simply download and use the provided .html file directly.

## Data storage & Backup
Please note that this is an **offline document**. All records are stored **locally in your browser**. To avoid data loss, make sure to **export your data regularly**. You can later restore your previous records by using the **import data** feature.

## Final Thoughts
I hope this idea helps you better organize your life amd make day-to-day tracking more enjoyable.😊
